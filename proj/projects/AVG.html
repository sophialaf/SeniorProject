            <h2>Welcome to the Albany Victory Gardens!</h2>
            <p>Albany Victory Gardens was established to fight for food equality
                <br>through the development of spaces that enable teaching,
                <br>recreational to subsistence gardening, and access to food
                <br>for urgent community food needs in the West Hill neighborhood of Albany.
            </p>
            <p>Beginning during World War II, victory gardens were established to combat
                <br>food shortages, boost moral and self respect, engender a sense of
                <br>independence among the unemployed, and to promote patriotism. Again in the
                <br>1970â€™s, a resurgence grew due to soaring food prices,
                <br>awakening consciousness to environmental issues, and neighborhood
                <br>revitalization movements. Victory gardens emphasized social
                <br>connectedness and grassroots activism.

            <p>While the Albany Victory Gardens has grown over
                <br>the last seven years into a streamlined food systems project,
                <br>the foundation is still rooted in providing food security and
                <br>economic independence. The fundamental goals for the garden still exist
                <br>at the forefront of our efforts.

            <p>Experienced gardeners and new participants share garden
                <br>plots to develop a more sustainable community by working
                <br>together and sharing in the fruits of their collective labors.
                <br> The tradition of sharing knowledge and experiential gardening wisdom
                <br>can bridge social, economic and diversity gaps as well as enable self
                <br>reliance and access to nutritious food. AVG was designed to recuperate
                <br>the culturally pertinent, economic viability of gardening through capacity
                <br> building (teaching/learning) and strengthening the tradition of sharing
                <br>gardening experience.
