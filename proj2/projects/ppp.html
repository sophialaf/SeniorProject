<h1>The Produce Pickup Project</h1>

<p>     The purpose of the Produce Pickup Project (PPP) is to increase health equity and nutritional access within the West
    Hill neighborhood of Albany, New York. The scarcity of nutritional access in this existing food desert has called
    our community to provide fresh produce on a recurring basis, helping to mitigate negative health impacts and improve
    wellness in the West Hill community. The overall mission of the PPP is to provide direct, accessible, and frequent
    access to fresh fruits and vegetables, bridging the gap between present, exacerbated health issues and critical
    nutrition for healing and the healthy development of mind and body.</p>

<p>Through a community-driven and operated service model, the Produce Pickup Project remains as a staple in the West
    Hill community. Daily operations require the pickup of produce every morning from the Regional County Food Bank
    where community members choose the most nutrient-dense, fresh, and culturally appropriate food items before
    transporting them back to the distribution site to be displayed in a dignified Farmers Market style for selection by
    neighbors eagerly awaiting their turn to fill up a box or bag.</p>

<p>The market is open Monday-Thursday starting at 10 am. Seasonal hours and weather may change this. Produce is served
    out of our West Hill Garden Market on 579 Clinton Avenue.</p>

<p>Given the need for nutrition access in helping mitigate health and wellness in the West Hill community, providing
    direct access to fresh produce will eventually help bridge the gap between health issues and necessary nutritional
    food. From August to December of 2022 we served 120,000 lbs of produce to nearly 5,000 families. From January to
    June of 2023 we served 75,000 meals to nearly 4,000 families in the West Hill Neighborhood. Currently, we distribute
    roughly 10,000 pounds of produce to roughly 400 families on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>The community that lives in West Hill is at risk of a myriad of health issues including high blood pressure and
    diabetes, therefore access to fresh vegetables is crucial for everyday health. Not to mention, the majority of the
    West Hills sits within a food desert making access to nutritional food difficult. Typically, populations living in a
    food desert are at greater risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity due to the lack of nutritional food
    access.</p>

<p>The market also serves as an educational opportunity for community residents to learn more about the community.</p>
