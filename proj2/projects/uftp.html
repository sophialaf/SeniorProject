<h1>Urban Farmers Training Program</h1>
<p>The Urban Farmer Training Program (UFTP) of The Eden’s Rose Foundation takes place at the Albany Victory Gardens. The
    UFTP will directly benefit Albany’s adult population, specifically in the West Hill neighborhood. Indirectly, we
    serve the entire community via creation of greenspaces, access to healthy food, job opportunity, and community
    investment. This is a farm to market, microeconomic and capacity development program for community members led by a
    committee of resident gardeners.
</p>
<p>We are creating and facilitating a neighborhood-scale community education food system project by providing free
    space, tools, and training to residents regardless of socioeconomic factors, race, religion, gender, nationality, or
    language. Throughout the growing season May 15th - 1st frost, we conduct 1-on-1 farmer training for 4 hours per
    week, teaching gardening techniques beginning the process of community food sovereignty and nutritional access. A
    committee-peer mentoring program will also be available throughout the season where successful urban farmers are
    paired with UFTP participants for Q&A in the training gardens once a week for 4 hours - promoting an interactive and
    cooperative environment for capacity development.
</p>
<p>We conclude with a FSMA training certificate course at season’s end. FSMA is a new national compliance standard for
    food production, required for produce farmers. This 20 hour food safety review and certificate course takes place
    over several days - with a produce safety alliance graduation held at the garden market. There is a potential to
    increase this curriculum to operate year round, by offering a more in-depth training involving soil development,
    postharvest process, and over winter gardening. Ultimately to achieve culturally pertinent economically viable and
    environmentally sustainable access to nutritional food resources through community-based agriculture; year-round
    gardening provides real solutions for our community, those most affected by social determinants that frame the West
    Hill Neighborhood as one of the most disadvantaged.
