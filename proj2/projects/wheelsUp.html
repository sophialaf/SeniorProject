    <h1>Wheels Up</h1>

    <p>Wheels Up is a youth engagement program in the New York Capital District. This program was first piloted in the winter of 2021.</p>

    <p>Wheels Up offers free bike fix up and donation services to those in need of transportation. We primarily offer these services to community youth. Our trained bike maintenance staff and volunteers will fix the bikes at predetermined events and actively engage the kids in the process. This creates an opportunity for mentorship amongst generations and skill sharing for youth growth and development. Eventually, it is our hope that the more youth we can train to maintain their bikes, the younger youth can learn from them. This would ultimately create a cycle of sharing skills, experiences, and peer-to-peer mentorship at crucial ages. Owning and being able to maintain their bikes also ensures that community youth will not be limited to an area of play. They can better explore the world around them and engage with other kids rather than spending idle time within their property lines. It encourages kids to build companionship, explore the world around them, and actively seek out passions they otherwise wouldn't be exposed to.</p>

    <p>As part of the Wheels Up Program, we will be enacting the Urban Mountain Biking Initiative. This initiative is an opportunity for youth in the West Hill Neighborhood of Albany to be supported in addressing the factors that contribute to gun violence. Through increased exposure to nature, increased group physical activity and recreation, diversified job training, and being a part of mentoring activities and training, youth will be exposed to tactful skills both physically and mentally.</p>

    <p>The goal is to provide outdoor training where kids will have the opportunity to learn through play in a green space. This can have groundbreaking results in bridging the capacity gap between urban, low-income youth and their direct relationship to nature. Ultimately, we hope this can offer valuable learned skill sets from outdoor play to result in future vocational training.</p>
