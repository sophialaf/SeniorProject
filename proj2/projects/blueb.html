    <h1>Lions Club Youth Blueberry Orchard</h1>

    <p>The Lions Club Youth Blueberry Orchard is an urban agricultural project at the Albany Victory Gardens that will
        directly address a number of important social issues within the West Hill neighborhood; such as food access,
        nutrition needs, green space, outdoor STEM education, and an Urban Farmer training program. This project intends
        to create a lasting installation to serve our community's needs for at least the next three decades. All of this
        is done in cooperation and guidance from a Community Coalition of Partners.</p>

    <p>The Youth Blueberry Orchard will utilize a multifaceted approach to address community needs. A strong focus will
        be on developing and implementing educational programs that will provide skills and capacity for community
        youth. The curriculum will include larger educational and learn-by-doing events that invite the greater
        community to learn and participate. These include, but are not limited to, spring pruning, summer pest
        management, and fall harvest/site clean up. The educational program will be an extracurricular option outside
        the curriculum from local educational institutions. School-age youth from the community will be able to
        participate in the program for free regardless of social-economic status.</p>

    <p>Additional community youth engagement will be facilitated through the City of Albanyâ€™s Summer Youth Employment
        Program. This program develops soft skills and pre-vocational aptitude training in an open and inviting
        environment. SYEP will achieve these goals by providing green space access, education, and work experience.</p>

    <p>Each year measurable results of improved food accessibility can be seen through successful harvests and
        monitoring of participation.</p>

    <p>Additional Food accessibility avenues include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Community open-air U-Pick free blueberry access</li>
        <li>Youth economic training program blueberry Market</li>
        <li>Sale at reduced and subsidized prices by Urban Farmer training program participants</li>
        <li>Educational programs for cooking and food preservation to integrate locally grown produce into daily diets
        </li>
        <li>Additional small crop plantings in the edge space around the orchard</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With improved nutritional access, community participation, and the increase of the resiliency of local Food
        Systems at the forefront of this project, the blueberry Orchard will play an integral component of the greater
        Albany Victory Gardens vision and directly increase access to Fresh Produce for community members.</p>
